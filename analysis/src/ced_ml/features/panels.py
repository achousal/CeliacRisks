"""Biomarker panel building with correlation pruning.

Constructs clinical biomarker panels from feature selection results by:
1. Building raw panels from selection frequencies (topN or frequency threshold)
2. Pruning highly correlated proteins using connected components
3. Refilling to target size from ranked candidate pool

Design:
- Pure functions operating on DataFrames and dictionaries
- No side effects: all outputs explicit
- Supports multiple panel sizes and correlation thresholds
- Graph-based correlation component detection

    """Build multiple panels of different sizes with correlation pruning.

    Convenience wrapper around prune_and_refill_panel for building
    nested panels (e.g., 10, 25, 50, 100, 200 proteins).

    Args:
        df: DataFrame containing protein columns (typically TRAIN set)
        y: Binary outcome array (required if tiebreak_method="freq_then_univariate")
        selection_freq: Dict mapping protein -> selection frequency
        panel_sizes: List of target panel sizes (e.g., [10, 25, 50, 100])
        corr_threshold: Correlation threshold for pruning
        pool_limit: Maximum number of candidates to consider (default: 3000)
        corr_method: Correlation method ("pearson" or "spearman")
        tiebreak_method: How to select representative ("freq" or "freq_then_univariate")

    Returns:
        Dict mapping panel_size -> (component_map, final_panel)

    Example:
        >>> df = pd.DataFrame(...)  # TRAIN set
        >>> freqs = {'A': 0.9, 'B': 0.8, ...}  # 100 proteins
