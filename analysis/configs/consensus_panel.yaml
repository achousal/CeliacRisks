# Consensus Panel Configuration
# Configuration for cross-model consensus panel generation via Robust Rank Aggregation
#
# USAGE (auto-detects paths from run metadata):
#   ced consensus-panel --run-id 20260127_115115  # All models (RECOMMENDED)
#
# All parameters can be overridden via CLI flags

# Stability threshold: minimum selection fraction to include a protein
# Proteins must be selected in >= this fraction of CV folds to be considered "stable"
stability_threshold: 0.50

# Correlation threshold for clustering redundant proteins
# Proteins with |correlation| >= this threshold are grouped, and one representative
# per cluster is kept (the one with highest consensus score)
corr_threshold: 0.85

# Target panel size after correlation pruning
# This is the final number of proteins in the consensus panel
target_size: 100

# Weight for RFE rank vs stability frequency in per-model composite scoring
# 0.0 = stability only, 1.0 = RFE only, 0.5 = equal weight (default)
# If RFE was not run for a model, stability-only scoring is used automatically
rfe_weight: 0.5

# RRA aggregation method for combining rankings across models
# Options:
#   - geometric_mean: Geometric mean of reciprocal ranks (penalizes missing proteins)
#   - borda: Borda count (sum of (N - rank + 1) across models)
#   - median: Median rank across models
rra_method: geometric_mean
