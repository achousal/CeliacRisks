# Splits Configuration - INVESTIGATION MODE
# Optimized for prevalent vs incident case comparison
# Ensures sufficient cases in ALL splits (train/val/test)

mode: development
scenarios:
  - IncidentPlusPrevalent

# Split sizes
val_size: 0.25
test_size: 0.25
holdout_size: 0.30  # Only used when mode=holdout

# Repeated splits
n_splits: 3
seed_start: 0

# Prevalent case handling - CRITICAL CHANGE
# Set to FALSE to include prevalent cases in VAL and TEST
prevalent_train_only: false  # Changed from true
prevalent_train_frac: 1.0     # Changed from 0.5 (no downsampling)

# Control downsampling
train_control_per_case: 1   # Increased from 5
eval_control_per_case: 1    # Increased from 5

# Temporal splits (optional)
# temporal_split: false
# temporal_col: CeD_date
# temporal_cutoff: null

# Output control
save_indices_only: false

# Expected split composition (for reference):
# TRAIN: ~74 incident + ~75 prevalent + 1490 controls = 1639 total
# VAL:   ~37 incident + ~37 prevalent + 740 controls = 814 total
# TEST:  ~37 incident + ~37 prevalent + 740 controls = 814 total
#
# This configuration ensures:
# 1. Sufficient cases in each split for statistical comparison (n≥30 per group)
# 2. Stratified distribution of prevalent cases across all splits
# 3. Balanced representation for investigation analysis
# 4. 80%+ power to detect medium effect sizes (Cohen's d ≥ 0.5)
