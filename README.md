## What is this?

A modular ML framework for predicting disease risk from proteomics or other high-dimensional biomarker data. Built for Celiac Disease prediction, but generalizable to any disease/biomarker combination.

**Core features:**
- Multi-model ensemble with stacking (RF, XGBoost, SVM, Logistic Regression)
- Five feature selection strategies (hybrid stability, nested RFECV, post-hoc RFE, cross-model consensus, fixed panel)
- Nested cross-validation with Bayesian hyperparameter optimization
- Unbiased calibration (OOF-posthoc strategy)
- Clinical decision curve analysis
- Cross-model consensus panel generation via Robust Rank Aggregation
- HPC-ready (LSF/Slurm) with full provenance tracking

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/achousal/CeliacRiskML.git
```

### Local
```bash
cd CeliacRiskML/
pip install -e analysis/
ced run-pipeline
```

### HPC
```bash
cd CeliacRiskML/
bash analysis/scripts/hpc_setup.sh

# Submit pipeline with LSF job dependency chains
ced run-pipeline --hpc

# Monitor jobs
bjobs -w | grep CeD_
```

**Pipeline flow:** Data → Split → Feature Selection → Model Training → Calibration → Ensemble → Evaluation

---

## What Can This Software Do?

### 1. Run the Full Pipeline (Local)
Run the complete pipeline on your machine with a single command:

```bash
cd CeliacRiskML/
ced run-pipeline
```

**What happens:** Auto-discovers data, trains 4 models (LR_EN, RF, LinSVM_cal, XGBoost) across splits with nested CV, hyperparameter tuning, calibration, ensemble, and panel optimization. Results in `results/`.

### 2. Run the Full Pipeline (HPC)
Submit batch jobs with automated resource management and dependency chains:

```bash
cd CeliacRiskML/
ced run-pipeline --hpc

# Monitor jobs
bjobs -w | grep CeD_
```

**Configure resources** in `analysis/configs/pipeline_hpc.yaml` (cores, memory, walltime, queue).

**What happens:**
1. Generates splits locally
2. Submits per-model training jobs to LSF
3. Chains aggregation, ensemble, and panel optimization as dependent jobs
4. Auto-detects everything from run-id

**No manual post-processing needed** - all steps are chained automatically.

### 3. CLI Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `ced run-pipeline` | End-to-end workflow orchestration (local or `--hpc`) |
| `ced save-splits` | Generate stratified train/val/test splits |
| `ced train` | Train a single model on one split |
| `ced train-ensemble` | Train stacking meta-learner on base model OOF predictions |
| `ced aggregate-splits` | Aggregate results across splits with bootstrap CIs |
| `ced optimize-panel` | Find minimal protein panel for a single model |
| `ced consensus-panel` | Cross-model consensus panel via Robust Rank Aggregation |
| `ced eval-holdout` | Evaluate on held-out test set |
| `ced config` | Validate or diff config files |
| `ced convert-to-parquet` | Convert CSV to Parquet format |

Run `ced --help` or `ced <command> --help` for full usage.

### Configuration-Based Workflow

All commands use YAML configs in `analysis/configs/`:

- `pipeline_local.yaml` / `pipeline_hpc.yaml` - Models, paths, execution settings
- `training_config.yaml` - Feature selection, calibration, ensemble
- `splits_config.yaml` - Train/val/test ratios

---

## Key Capabilities

### ML Pipeline
- **Models**: Logistic Regression (ElasticNet), Random Forest, XGBoost, Linear SVM
- **Ensemble**: Out-of-fold stacking with L2 meta-learner
- **Feature Selection**: Five strategies optimized for different use cases
  - Hybrid stability (default, ~30 min)
  - Nested RFECV (scientific discovery, ~22 hrs)
  - Post-hoc RFE (single-model deployment, ~10 min)
  - Cross-model consensus via RRA (robust deployment, ~15 min)
  - Fixed panel validation (regulatory, ~30 min)
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optuna Bayesian optimization or grid search
- **Temporal Validation**: Chronological splits to prevent future data leakage

### Evaluation
- **Discrimination**: AUROC, PR-AUC with bootstrap CIs
- **Calibration**: Brier score, slope/intercept, calibration curves (OOF-posthoc)
- **Clinical Utility**: Decision curve analysis with auto-configured threshold ranges
- **Visualizations**: ROC/PR curves, calibration plots, risk distributions, DCA plots

### Production Features
- **Reproducibility**: Fixed seeds, YAML configs, Git commit tracking
- **HPC Support**: LSF/Slurm array jobs with automated post-processing (conda/venv compatible)
- **Provenance**: Complete metadata for every run (config, environment, timing)
- **Investigation Framework**: Factorial experiment design for methodological optimization
